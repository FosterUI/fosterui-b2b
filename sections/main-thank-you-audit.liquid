        <p>
          I've received your information. I will now personally conduct a strategic review of your Shopify store,
          focusing on the key bottlenecks that typically hinder B2B growth. I will record a 5-minute Loom video with my
          initial findings and send it directly to your inbox.
        </p>

        <h3>Expectations</h3>
        <p>
          Please allow 2-3 business days for this analysis. I take the time to ensure my insights are specific,
          actionable, and valuable.
        </p>

        <h3>While you wait...</h3>
        <p>I recommend exploring these insights on the challenges and opportunities for B2B on Shopify Plus:</p>
