      <h2>I'm Reviewing Your Request to Book the Roadmap.</h2>

      <div class="rte">
        <p>
          Thank you for taking the first step. I personally review every Roadmap request to ensure it's a strong
          strategic fit before scheduling a call. This ensures our time together is maximally productive.
        </p>

        <h3>Next Steps</h3>
        <p>
          Please look for a personal email from me within one business day. If your project aligns with my expertise,
          that email will contain a private link to my calendar to book our 25-minute discovery call.
        </p>

        <h3>Value Reinforcement</h3>
        <p>
          In the meantime, you can get a better sense of my approach by reviewing my methodology. This is the exact
          process I use to identify and blueprint the solutions for scaling your B2B channel.
