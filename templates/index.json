            "question": "How is Shopify B2B different from using discount codes or wholesale apps?",
            "answer": "<p>The native Shopify B2B suite is fundamentally different. Discount codes are a workaround that corrupts analytics and requires manual effort. Third-party apps often create disconnected data silos. Shopify B2B integrates directly into the core platform, offering robust features like Company Profiles, Custom Catalogs, and Net Terms, allowing you to manage DTC and B2B seamlessly from one backend.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>Yes. Shopify Plus supports a \"Blended Storefront\" approach. Your DTC experience remains unchanged, but when a wholesale buyer logs in, the storefront dynamically adapts to display their specific catalog, pricing, and payment terms. This provides a unified brand experience and operational efficiency.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>ERP integration is often the most complex part of a B2B launch. While connectors exist, the challenge lies in data mapping, managing API limits, and handling complex B2B pricing rules. A successful integration requires a strategic blueprint to avoid costly operational disruptions and ensure a single source of truth. This is a core part of my methodology.</p>"

AI forecasting moves beyond spreadsheet guesswork by analyzing complex, real-time data to prevent stockouts and free up capital. AI personalization delivers tailored product recommendations and dynamic content at scale, increasing B2B order frequency and AOV.</p>"

My methodology utilizes a 5-day deep-dive audit (The Roadmap) followed by a 4-week intensive execution project (The Implementation Sprint). This approach prioritizes velocity and delivers a functional, professional wholesale channel in just over a month.</p>"

This hyper-specialization allows me to execute faster, identify bottlenecks others miss (using my proprietary AI audit system), and deliver quantifiable revenue lift, rather than just code.</p>"
