Third-party apps often create disconnected data silos. Shopify B2B integrates directly into the core platform, offering robust features like Company Profiles, Custom Catalogs, and Net Terms, allowing you to manage DTC and B2B seamlessly from one backend.</p>"

Your DTC experience remains unchanged, but when a wholesale buyer logs in, the storefront dynamically adapts to display their specific catalog, pricing, and payment terms. This provides a unified brand experience and operational efficiency.</p>"

            "answer": "<p>ERP integration is often the most complex part of a B2B launch. While connectors exist, the challenge lies in data mapping, managing API limits, and handling complex B2B pricing rules. A successful integration requires a strategic blueprint to avoid costly operational disruptions and ensure a single source of truth. This is a core part of my methodology.</p>"

AI forecasting moves beyond spreadsheet guesswork by analyzing complex, real-time data to prevent stockouts and free up capital.
