Your Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system was supposed to be the central nervous system for your expanding B2B operations, but instead, you have significant budget overruns, a frustrated team, and a B2B launch that is stalling on the runway.</p><p>This is one of the most expensive and demoralizing setbacks a growing DTC brand can face. But the problem is rarely the technology itself. ERP integration projects don't fail because of technical glitches; they fail because of fundamental strategic missteps. They fail because the strategy was flawed long before the first line of code was written. <strong>This isn’t a technical problem; it’s a leadership vacuum.</strong></p><p>The good news is that these failures are predictable and preventable. They almost always stem from the same three strategic oversights:</p><ol><li><strong>Lack of Clear Objectives & Inadequate Planning:</strong> Teams kick off with vague goals (“improve efficiency”) and no measurable success criteria, inviting scope creep and misalignment. Gartner notes that <strong>more than 70% of recently implemented ERP initiatives will fail to fully meet their original business goals by 2027</strong>, driven in part by technology‑centric approaches that ignore stakeholder engagement.[1]</li><li><strong>Poor Data Management & Migration:</strong> Data migration is a chronic risk area. Multiple studies show <strong>a high proportion of migrations run late or over budget</strong>, and that business participation — not just IT — is essential. Experian reports <strong>85% of organizations encounter migration challenges that throw off timelines and budgets</strong>; Bloor’s survey work historically found <strong>only 16% of projects (2007) delivered on time/on budget, improving to 62% by 2011</strong> after better practices were adopted.[2][3][4]</li><li><strong>Lack of Stakeholder Alignment & User Adoption:</strong> Treating the integration as an “IT project” isolates it from operations and sales. Gartner stresses that <strong>stakeholder engagement is a prerequisite</strong> to meeting business expectations — not just a nice‑to‑have.[1]</li></ol><p>If you’re seeing the symptoms of a stalled integration, it’s because one or more of these foundational cracks are undermining your entire investment.</p>",
